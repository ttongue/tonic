Dear #FIRST_NAME# #LAST_NAME#,

Thank you for being a member of the Tech Valley Center of Gravity!
Our records indicate that you are paid through #PAID_THRU#, and your membership
is now past due. You can now pay your current membership fees and sign up for
recurring billing using our new billing system at:

     https://ssl.techvalleycenterofgravity.com/billing/recurring.py

This system is secure and PCI compliant, and does not store credit card
information locally, but instead uses a subscription billing service offered
through the credit card processor. Alternatively, you can just make a payment 
via Paypal using:
