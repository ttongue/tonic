====IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS====
You've taken the first important step toward becoming a member of the Tech 

Valley Center of Gravity, but you need to complete the following steps to 
finish the new member process:

   -- New members MUST complete the mandatory safety training class</b> prior
      to working in the makerspace for liability reasons. Please
      view the green tool safety training at:

           https://youtu.be/B1KgaohH9Ec

      and then take the safety quiz at:
 
           http://www.tvcog.net/safety-training-quiz/

   --  Once the safety training quiz is complete, you can request an 
       access control fob to let you into the Center of Gravity using
       the form at:

           http://www.tvcog.net/access-control-fob-request-form/

       This form requires a good quality headshot (think passport!) 
       for our records for identification purposes.                            

   -- If you'd like to have training on the equipment, there is a series of
      events titled "Zero To Maker" that is run to help new members learn
      the basics of laser cutting, 3D printing, wood shop and other areas.
      Please check our online calendar at http://tvcog.net/my-calendar/ for 
      an up-to-date schedule.

   -- If you have not already done so, please join the Facebook page 
      (see http://www.facebook.com/groups/capitaldistrictindustrialclub/ )
      to keep in touch with other members, and check the calendar at
      http://www.techvalleycenterofgravity.com/ for new events!
