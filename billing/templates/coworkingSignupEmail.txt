====IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS====
You've taken the first important step toward becoming a member of the Tech 
Valley Center of Gravity, but you need to complete the following steps to 
finish the new member process:

   --  You can request an access control fob to let you into the Center 
       of Gravity using the form at:

           http://www.tvcog.net/access-control-fob-request-form/

       This form requires a good quality headshot (think passport!) 
       for our records for identification purposes.                            

   -- If you have not already done so, please join the Facebook page
