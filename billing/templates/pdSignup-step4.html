<p>Thank you for using the online signup process for the Tech Valley Center of Gravity.</p>

<p class=important>IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS:</p>
<p>You've taken the first important step toward becoming a member of the Tech Valley Center of Gravity, but you need to complete the following steps to finish the new member process:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>New members MUST complete the mandatory safety training class</b> prior to working in the makerspace for liability reasons. Please <a href=https://youtu.be/B1KgaohH9Ec>view the green tool safety video</a> here, and then <a href=http://www.tvcog.net/safety-training-quiz/>take the quiz</a>.
<li>  Once the safety training quiz is complete, you can request an 
      access control fob to let you into the Center of Gravity using
      the <a href=http://www.tvcog.net/access-control-fob-request-form/ target=_new>access fob request form</a>. This form requires a good quality headshot (think passport!) for our records for identification purposes.   

<li>If you'd like to have training on the equipment, there is a series of
      events titled "Zero To Maker" that is run to help new members learn
      the basics of laser cutting, 3D printing, wood shop and other areas.
      Please check our <a href=http://tvcog.net/my-calendar/ target=_new>online
      calendar</a> for an up-to-date schedule.

<li>If you have not already done so, please <a href=http://www.facebook.com/groups/capitaldistrictindustrialclub/ target=_new>join the Facebook page</a> to keep in touch with other members, and check the <a href=http://www.tvcog.net/index.php/my-calendar/ target=_new>calendar</a> frequently for new events!
</ul>

<p>Thank you for becoming a part of the Tech Valley Center of Gravity!
